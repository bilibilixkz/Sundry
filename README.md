## Information
This repository stores some code that I would like to open source, or theoretically I'm being asked to open source, but they are too small to create a repository for each code.
Different projects are in different folders, and i try my best to keep the folder names simple and easy to understand.

## License
Please check the LICENSE file in the folder.
