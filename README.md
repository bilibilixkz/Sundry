## Information
This repository stores the code which I would like to open source or I have been asked to open source theoretically, but they are too small to create a repository for each of them.
Different projects are in different folders, and i try my best to keep the folder names simple and easy to understand.

## License
Please check the LICENSE file in the folder.
